# Weather-Dashboard
Weather Dashboard:
    This application allows you to search for any city in the world, and recieve the current weather, including: tempurature, wind speed, humidity, UV index, and current conditions. It also will give you the forecast for the next five days. It will also store your search history in the local storage and show your search history on the page. You can click on any of the cities you have recently searched for, and it will bring up the weather for that city again. I also added a button to clear your history, which will remove them from your screen, and from your local storage.

Challenges:
    Throughout this project, there have been many problems that arouse, that took a lot of time to find the answer for. One problem I was having, was that everytime you either clicked on one of your previous searches, or searched for a new city, the five day forecast would pop up, but the old one remained. It kept stacking. I worked for hours by myself and with others to figure this problem out, and it ended up being one line of code that I missed. There were several more difficulties that I ran into, but the lesson I have learned not only in this application, but others that I have completed, is that I just need to go through the entire process of how to computer is reading the code, and think about it logically.

Technologies Utilized:
    For this application, I used the Open Weather Map data API. I used three different API requests to grab the current weather, the UV index, and the five day forecast. For my styling of the page, I used Bootstrap almost exclusivly.
